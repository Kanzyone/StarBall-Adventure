# StarBall Adventure
StarBall Adventure is a modular 3D maze arcade game built with Three.js.  
Players control a rolling star ball, collect stars, avoid enemies, and progress through increasingly difficult levels.

This project is designed with a professional modular structure and aims to evolve into a fully featured indie web game.
